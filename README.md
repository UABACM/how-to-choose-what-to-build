## How to Choose What to Build as a CS Student

- Michael Gathara

### 1. Start with a clear goal  
Every project should teach you something. Ask yourself:  
- **What skill do I want to sharpen?** (e.g. frontend frameworks, backend systems, data pipelines)  
- **What role am I aiming for?** (e.g. full-stakc engineer, backend Engineer, machine learning engineer)  
- **What problem do I want to solve?** (e.g. automate a boring task, explore open data, game mechanics)  

By setting a target, I typically find it easier to have motivation to follow through with the project. 

### 2. Follow your curiosity  
Great projects begin with genuine interest. If you never want to make mobile apps then find yourself trying to one by yourself then you might just be cooked.  
- **Open source issues**: pick a bug or feature request in a library you use.  
- **Hacker News threads**: see what new tools or APIs spark discussion.  
- **Real world needs**: talk to friends, family, or professors about workflows that could use automation.  

When you care, you’ll finish the project.

### 3. Scope it
Ambition is good but can kill momentum if the project grows too big. You typically would need a lot of agency to push yourself through an ambitious project.
1. **Minimum viable version**: list the core features you need to build a working demo. It's okay if you do not like the first version
2. **Stretch goals**: anything you’d add if the core is stable.  
3. **Future ideas**: enhancements that can wait until after you ship.  

### 4. Choose the right tech mix  
A personal project is a safe place to try new tools. Try to balance your stack in a way like:  
- **Seventy percent core expertise**: languages and frameworks you already know.  
- **Thirty percent exploration**: a new database, a CI tool, a cloud service, or a library you’ve only read about.  

The goal is to just keep moving without finding yourself reading documentation for every single feature you want to implement

### 5. Build for feedback  
One thing I've come to learn is that nobody cares about your project, so you may as well just share it. Best case, someone finds it cool and comments/likes and worst case nothing happens just like it was going to be irregardless of you posting
- **GitHub repo**: include a clear readme and screenshots.  
- **Developer forums or social media**: post your progress as you add more features
- **Demo video**: record a short walkthrough to show how your project works.  (ScreenStudio, Cursorful)

### 6. Document your journey  
Good projects come with good stories. Keep notes on:  
- **Why you chose this project**  
- **Roadblocks you hit and how you fixed them**  
- **Key lessons and trade offs**  

You can turn these notes into a blog post or an engineering journal entry. That makes your work visible to recruiters and peers. Tbh, I am really bad at this

### 7. Iterate and polish  
Once the core works:  
1. **Refactor**: clean up the code, add tests, improve error handling.  
2. **Optimize**: profile slow parts, address performance issues.  
3. **Style**: refine the user interface, improve user experience, add accessibility.  

Maintaince is ~80% of the work you will do as a SWE in the industry, you may as well get good at it in your personal projects too.

### 8. Putting it into Practice  
- **Pick one idea today**. Spend 15 minutes writing down goals and a rough timeline.  
- **Set a mini milestone**. Decide on a one-week deliverable, like a basic demo or prototype.  
- **Code regularly**. Block a couple hours a day or ~5-10 hours/week to code, review progress, and adjust scope.  
- **Share your first demo**. Throw it up on X or Linkedin or Reddit
- **Reflect and repeat**. After you hit your milestone, note what you learned, then start the next project or add a stretch goal.
